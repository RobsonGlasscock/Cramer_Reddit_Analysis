Data and analyses related to a Reddit thread about Jim Cramer's stock selections. 

Here is the original analysis that was posted: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/mte1rw/i_analyzed_all_700_buy_and_sell_recommendations/

The author of the original post concluded that looking at Cramer's buy recommendations from around the first quarter of 2021 would result in a 555% cumulative return. The author calculated returns on around 600 individual stocks and then summed up each stock's return to arrive at this figure. In my opinion, the actual cumulative return was around 0.4%. The reason for the difference in the return figures is that the weight of each stock in the overall portfolio was not considered by the author.
